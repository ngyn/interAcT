# interAcT
The goal of this project is to establish a website that creates a presence for the new built startup “InterAct” (Accomplish and Thrive) which promotes the company and support the funding of the app and the company itself.  This website should be designed to cater to parents of autistic children. It should also cater to adult members of the community with autism.
